This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.



## Expense-Tracker
In this project I gathered and developed requirements for a React application with responsive design using Redux to manage its state. 

The main objectif was to develope custom functionality in React to manage balance, income, expenses and transactions to help with budgeting
